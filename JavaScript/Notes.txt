Javascript is a simple programming language that is used to create small programming logic inside web pages. The programming languages written in web pages are called as Scripting languages. 
Javascript is executed inside the browser where the pages are displayed. Hense its called as Client side scripting language. 

Programs of JS can be embedded into web pages using <script> tag and must be ended with </script> tag. U can include the script tag where ever U want. However we recommend to use <script> only in  <head> section of the web page.
