Javascript is a simple programming language that is used to create small programming logic inside web pages. The programming languages written in web pages are called as Scripting languages. 
Javascript is executed inside the browser where the pages are displayed. Hense its called as Client side scripting language. 

Programs of JS can be embedded into web pages using <script> tag and must be ended with </script> tag. U can include the script tag where ever U want. However we recommend to use <script> only in  <head> section of the web page.

How to store data that user enters?

How to display the data with our static Text. 
Create a Math Calculator. 


User enters the data in the form of prompt or Forms. HTML Forms do have tags which will allow the user to enter inputs into the Tags. 
These data are stored inside our programs so that we can use them whenever we want. This storage points are called variables. 

let keyword is used to declare a variable and store data in it.
variable is something that is used to store a value which can be modified later. It is not wrong to use the same variable again and again but it will replace the old value while U set a new value to it. To retain all values we need to create different variables. let can be used once for a given variable. 

const is used only on those data that is not intended to modify. 

all the data entered by the user will be strings. to convert a string to a number value we use a function called parseInt.
